--- KPI: Efficiency % ---
  Efficiency (visit / (shift − break))     67.36%  [staffing]
  Travel efficiency (visit / (visit+travel))  96.73%  [field, target >67.5%]
  Wait efficiency (visit / (visit+travel+wait))  87.93%
  Idle efficiency (visit / (visit+travel+idle))  71.75%  [≈ efficiency]

--- Times (h:min) ---
  shift   = 1790h 0min
  visit   = 1113h 45min
  travel  = 37h 37min
  wait    = 115h 12min
  break   = 136h 30min
  idle    = 400h 50min  [inactive / empty shift time]
  sum     = 1803h 54min  (visit+travel+wait+break+idle)

--- Counts ---
  Employees (vehicles):  21  (empty: 0)
  Shifts:                207  (with visits: 207, empty: 0)
  Visits assigned:       2921 / 2921
  Unassigned:            0

--- Input ---
  Care visits: 2819 (2717 solo + 102 double-employee)
  Timefold visits: 2921 (2717 solo + 204 in 102 groups)
  Time window slots: 2921 (movable across weeks)

--- Time equation: shift = visit + travel + wait + break + idle ---
  shift  = 1790h 0min  (100.00%)
  visit  = 1113h 45min  (62.22%)
  travel = 37h 37min  (2.10%)
  wait   = 115h 12min  (6.44%)
  break  = 136h 30min  (7.63%)
  idle   = 400h 50min  (22.39%)
  sum    = 1803h 54min
  visit/shift = 62.22%
