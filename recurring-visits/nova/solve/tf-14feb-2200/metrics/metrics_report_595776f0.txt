--- KPI: Efficiency % ---
  Efficiency (visit / (shift − break))     31.23%  [staffing]
  Travel efficiency (visit / (visit+travel))  96.73%  [field, target >67.5%]
  Wait efficiency (visit / (visit+travel+wait))  87.93%
  Idle efficiency (visit / (visit+travel+idle))  32.15%  [≈ efficiency]
  System efficiency (visit / all provisioned)  31.23%  [incl. 249 empty shifts]

--- Times (h:min) ---
  shift   = 3827h 0min
  visit   = 1113h 45min
  travel  = 37h 37min
  wait    = 115h 12min
  break   = 261h 0min
  idle    = 2313h 20min  [inactive / empty shift time]
  sum     = 3840h 54min  (visit+travel+wait+break+idle)

--- Counts ---
  Employees (vehicles):  24  (empty: 3)
  Shifts:                456  (with visits: 207, empty: 249)

--- Time equation: shift = visit + travel + wait + break + idle ---
  shift  = 3827h 0min  (100.00%)
  visit  = 1113h 45min  (29.10%)
  travel = 37h 37min  (0.98%)
  wait   = 115h 12min  (3.01%)
  break  = 261h 0min  (6.82%)
  idle   = 2313h 20min  (60.45%)
  sum    = 3840h 54min
  visit/shift = 29.10%
