--- KPI: Efficiency % ---
  Efficiency (visit / (shift − break))     92.66%  [staffing]
  Travel efficiency (visit / (visit+travel))  97.08%  [field, target >67.5%]
  Wait efficiency (visit / (visit+travel+wait))  88.22%
  Idle efficiency (visit / (visit+travel+idle))  97.08%  [≈ efficiency]

--- Times (h:min) ---
  shift   = 1338h 26min
  visit   = 1113h 45min
  travel  = 33h 32min
  wait    = 115h 12min
  break   = 136h 30min
  idle    = 0h 0min  [inactive / empty shift time]
  sum     = 1398h 59min  (visit+travel+wait+break+idle)

--- Counts ---
  Employees (vehicles):  21  (empty: 0)
  Shifts:                207  (with visits: 207, empty: 0)
  Visits assigned:       2921 / 2921
  Unassigned:            0

--- Input ---
  Care visits: 2921 (2717 solo + 102 double-employee)
  Timefold visits: 2921 (2717 solo + 204 in 102 groups)
  Time window slots: 2921

--- Time equation: shift = visit + travel + wait + break + idle ---
  shift  = 1338h 26min  (100.00%)
  visit  = 1113h 45min  (83.21%)
  travel = 33h 32min  (2.51%)
  wait   = 115h 12min  (8.61%)
  break  = 136h 30min  (10.20%)
  idle   = 0h 0min  (0.00%)
  sum    = 1398h 59min
  visit/shift = 83.21%
