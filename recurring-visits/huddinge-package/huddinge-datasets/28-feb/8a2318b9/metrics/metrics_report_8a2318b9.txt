TIMEFOLD FSR METRICS REPORT
========================================================================

--- Key metrics ---
  Paid time (shift − break)  = 2409h 30min  [salary cost]
  Visit time (value)         = 1491h 46min  [care delivery / revenue]
  Travel + wait (minimize)    = 201h 55min  [cost to minimize]

--- KPI: Efficiency % ---
  Efficiency (visit / (shift − break))     61.91%  [staffing]
  Travel efficiency (visit / (visit+travel))  90.37%  [field, target >67.5%]
  Wait efficiency (visit / (visit+travel+wait))  88.08%
  Idle efficiency (visit / (visit+travel+idle))  63.04%  [≈ efficiency]
  System efficiency (visit / all provisioned)  61.91%  [incl. 41 empty shifts]

--- Times (h:min) ---
  shift   = 2502h 0min
  visit   = 1491h 46min
  travel  = 158h 55min
  wait    = 43h 0min
  break   = 92h 30min
  idle    = 715h 49min  [inactive / empty shift time]
  sum     = 2502h 0min  (visit+travel+wait+break+idle)

--- Counts ---
  Employees (vehicles):  38  (empty: 0)
  Shifts:                340  (with visits: 299, empty: 41)

  Unassigned:            112

--- Input ---
  Care visits: 3478 (3334 solo + 144 double-employee)

--- Time equation: shift = visit + travel + wait + break + idle ---
  shift  = 2502h 0min  (100.00%)
  visit  = 1491h 46min  (59.62%)
  travel = 158h 55min  (6.35%)
  wait   = 43h 0min  (1.72%)
  break  = 92h 30min  (3.70%)
  idle   = 715h 49min  (28.61%)
  sum    = 2502h 0min
  visit/shift = 59.62%
