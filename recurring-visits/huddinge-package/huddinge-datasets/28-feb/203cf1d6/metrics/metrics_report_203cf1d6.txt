TIMEFOLD FSR METRICS REPORT
========================================================================

--- Key metrics ---
  Paid time (shift − break)  = 2408h 30min  [salary cost]
  Visit time (value)         = 1502h 36min  [care delivery / revenue]
  Travel + wait (minimize)    = 221h 38min  [cost to minimize]

--- KPI: Efficiency % ---
  Efficiency (visit / (shift − break))     62.39%  [staffing]
  Travel efficiency (visit / (visit+travel))  89.91%  [field, target >67.5%]
  Wait efficiency (visit / (visit+travel+wait))  87.15%
  Idle efficiency (visit / (visit+travel+idle))  63.79%  [≈ efficiency]
  System efficiency (visit / all provisioned)  62.39%  [incl. 40 empty shifts]

--- Times (h:min) ---
  shift   = 2502h 0min
  visit   = 1502h 36min
  travel  = 168h 34min
  wait    = 53h 4min
  break   = 93h 30min
  idle    = 684h 16min  [inactive / empty shift time]
  sum     = 2502h 0min  (visit+travel+wait+break+idle)

--- Counts ---
  Employees (vehicles):  38  (empty: 0)
  Shifts:                340  (with visits: 300, empty: 40)
  Visits assigned:       3554 / 3622
  Unassigned:            68

--- Input ---
  Care visits: 3478 (3334 solo + 144 double-employee)
  Timefold visits: 3622 (3334 solo + 288 in 144 groups)

--- Time equation: shift = visit + travel + wait + break + idle ---
  shift  = 2502h 0min  (100.00%)
  visit  = 1502h 36min  (60.06%)
  travel = 168h 34min  (6.74%)
  wait   = 53h 4min  (2.12%)
  break  = 93h 30min  (3.74%)
  idle   = 684h 16min  (27.35%)
  sum    = 2502h 0min
  visit/shift = 60.06%
