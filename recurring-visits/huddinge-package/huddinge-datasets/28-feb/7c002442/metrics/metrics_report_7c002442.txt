TIMEFOLD FSR METRICS REPORT
========================================================================

--- Key metrics ---
  Paid time (shift − break)  = 2409h 0min  [salary cost]
  Visit time (value)         = 1491h 46min  [care delivery / revenue]
  Travel + wait (minimize)    = 199h 8min  [cost to minimize]

--- KPI: Efficiency % ---
  Efficiency (visit / (shift − break))     61.92%  [staffing]
  Travel efficiency (visit / (visit+travel))  90.58%  [field, target >67.5%]
  Wait efficiency (visit / (visit+travel+wait))  88.22%
  Idle efficiency (visit / (visit+travel+idle))  63.08%  [≈ efficiency]
  System efficiency (visit / all provisioned)  61.92%  [incl. 50 empty shifts]

--- Times (h:min) ---
  shift   = 2502h 0min
  visit   = 1491h 46min
  travel  = 155h 11min
  wait    = 43h 58min
  break   = 93h 0min
  idle    = 718h 6min  [inactive / empty shift time]
  sum     = 2502h 0min  (visit+travel+wait+break+idle)

--- Counts ---
  Employees (vehicles):  38  (empty: 0)
  Shifts:                340  (with visits: 290, empty: 50)
  Visits assigned:       3510 / 3622
  Unassigned:            112

--- Input ---
  Care visits: 3478 (3334 solo + 144 double-employee)
  Timefold visits: 3622 (3334 solo + 288 in 144 groups)

--- Time equation: shift = visit + travel + wait + break + idle ---
  shift  = 2502h 0min  (100.00%)
  visit  = 1491h 46min  (59.62%)
  travel = 155h 11min  (6.20%)
  wait   = 43h 58min  (1.76%)
  break  = 93h 0min  (3.72%)
  idle   = 718h 6min  (28.70%)
  sum    = 2502h 0min
  visit/shift = 59.62%
