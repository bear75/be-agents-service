TIMEFOLD FSR METRICS REPORT
========================================================================

--- Key metrics ---
  Paid time (shift − break)  = 1781h 21min  [salary cost]
  Visit time (value)         = 1515h 37min  [care delivery / revenue]
  Travel + wait (minimize)    = 244h 22min  [cost to minimize]

--- KPI: Efficiency % ---
  Efficiency (visit / (shift − break))     85.08%  [staffing]
  Travel efficiency (visit / (visit+travel))  86.97%  [field, target >67.5%]
  Wait efficiency (visit / (visit+travel+wait))  86.11%
  Idle efficiency (visit / (visit+travel+idle))  85.91%  [≈ efficiency]

--- Times (h:min) ---
  shift   = 1861h 51min
  visit   = 1515h 37min
  travel  = 227h 9min
  wait    = 17h 14min
  break   = 80h 30min
  idle    = 21h 22min  [inactive / empty shift time]
  sum     = 1861h 51min  (visit+travel+wait+break+idle)

--- Counts ---
  Employees (vehicles):  42  (empty: 0)
  Shifts:                311  (with visits: 311, empty: 0)
  Visits assigned:       3616 / 3622
  Unassigned:            6

--- Input ---
  Care visits: 3478 (3334 solo + 144 double-employee)
  Timefold visits: 3622 (3334 solo + 288 in 144 groups)
  Time window slots: 3622 (movable across weeks)
  Vehicles: 42  Shifts: 311

--- Time equation: shift = visit + travel + wait + break + idle ---
  shift  = 1861h 51min  (100.00%)
  visit  = 1515h 37min  (81.40%)
  travel = 227h 9min  (12.20%)
  wait   = 17h 14min  (0.93%)
  break  = 80h 30min  (4.32%)
  idle   = 21h 22min  (1.15%)
  sum    = 1861h 51min
  visit/shift = 81.40%
