TIMEFOLD FSR METRICS REPORT  (EXCLUDING INACTIVE)
========================================================================

--- Key metrics ---
  Paid time (shift − break)  = 1852h 31min  [salary cost]
  Visit time (value)         = 1502h 58min  [care delivery / revenue]
  Travel + wait (minimize)    = 349h 33min  [cost to minimize]

--- KPI: Efficiency % ---
  Efficiency (visit / (shift − break))     81.13%  [staffing]
  Travel efficiency (visit / (visit+travel))  83.48%  [field, target >67.5%]
  Wait efficiency (visit / (visit+travel+wait))  81.13%
  Idle efficiency (visit / (visit+travel+idle))  83.48%  [≈ efficiency]

--- Times (h:min) ---
  shift   = 1948h 1min
  visit   = 1502h 58min
  travel  = 297h 30min
  wait    = 52h 3min
  break   = 95h 30min
  idle    = 0h 0min  [inactive / empty shift time]
  sum     = 1948h 1min  (visit+travel+wait+break+idle)

--- Counts ---
  Employees (vehicles):  38  (empty: 0)
  Shifts:                311  (with visits: 311, empty: 0)
  Visits assigned:       3562 / 3622
  Unassigned:            60

--- Time equation: shift = visit + travel + wait + break + idle ---
  shift  = 1948h 1min  (100.00%)
  visit  = 1502h 58min  (77.15%)
  travel = 297h 30min  (15.27%)
  wait   = 52h 3min  (2.67%)
  break  = 95h 30min  (4.90%)
  idle   = 0h 0min  (0.00%)
  sum    = 1948h 1min
  visit/shift = 77.15%

--- Time & Cost Breakdown (inactive removed: 0h 0min / 0 kr) ---
  Category                     Time   % shift   Cost (kr)    Rev (kr)
