TIMEFOLD FSR METRICS REPORT
========================================================================

--- Key metrics ---
  Paid time (shift − break)  = 26011h 30min  [salary cost]
  Visit time (value)         = 1516h 4min  [care delivery / revenue]
  Travel + wait (minimize)    = 619h 1min  [cost to minimize]

--- KPI: Efficiency % ---
  Efficiency (visit / (shift − break))     5.83%  [staffing]
  Travel efficiency (visit / (visit+travel))  77.68%  [field, target >67.5%]
  Wait efficiency (visit / (visit+travel+wait))  71.01%
  Idle efficiency (visit / (visit+travel+idle))  5.87%  [≈ efficiency]
  System efficiency (visit / all provisioned)  5.83%  [incl. 3094 empty shifts]

--- Times (h:min) ---
  shift   = 26096h 0min
  visit   = 1516h 4min
  travel  = 435h 39min
  wait    = 183h 21min
  break   = 84h 30min
  idle    = 23876h 25min  [inactive / empty shift time]
  sum     = 26096h 0min  (visit+travel+wait+break+idle)

--- Counts ---
  Employees (vehicles):  38  (empty: 0)
  Shifts:                3630  (with visits: 536, empty: 3094)
  Visits assigned:       3618 / 3622
  Unassigned:            4

--- Input ---
  Care visits: 3478 (3334 solo + 144 double-employee)
  Timefold visits: 3622 (3334 solo + 288 in 144 groups)
  Time window slots: 3622 (movable across weeks)

--- Time equation: shift = visit + travel + wait + break + idle ---
  shift  = 26096h 0min  (100.00%)
  visit  = 1516h 4min  (5.81%)
  travel = 435h 39min  (1.67%)
  wait   = 183h 21min  (0.70%)
  break  = 84h 30min  (0.32%)
  idle   = 23876h 25min  (91.49%)
  sum    = 26096h 0min
  visit/shift = 5.81%
