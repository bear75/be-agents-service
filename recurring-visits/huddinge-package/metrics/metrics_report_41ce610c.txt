TIMEFOLD FSR METRICS REPORT
========================================================================

--- Key metrics ---
  Paid time (shift − break)  = 2421h 0min  [salary cost]
  Visit time (value)         = 1506h 46min  [care delivery / revenue]
  Travel + wait (minimize)    = 170h 45min  [cost to minimize]

--- KPI: Efficiency % ---
  Efficiency (visit / (shift − break))     62.24%  [staffing]
  Travel efficiency (visit / (visit+travel))  90.18%  [field, target >67.5%]
  Wait efficiency (visit / (visit+travel+wait))  89.82%
  Idle efficiency (visit / (visit+travel+idle))  62.41%  [≈ efficiency]
  System efficiency (visit / all provisioned)  62.24%  [incl. 79 empty shifts]

--- Times (h:min) ---
  shift   = 2502h 0min
  visit   = 1506h 46min
  travel  = 164h 5min
  wait    = 6h 40min
  break   = 81h 0min
  idle    = 743h 29min  [inactive / empty shift time]
  sum     = 2502h 0min  (visit+travel+wait+break+idle)

--- Counts ---
  Employees (vehicles):  38  (empty: 0)
  Shifts:                340  (with visits: 261, empty: 79)
  Visits assigned:       3580 / 3622
  Unassigned:            42

--- Input ---
  Care visits: 3478 (3334 solo + 144 double-employee)
  Timefold visits: 3622 (3334 solo + 288 in 144 groups)
  Time window slots: 3622 (movable across weeks)

--- Time equation: shift = visit + travel + wait + break + idle ---
  shift  = 2502h 0min  (100.00%)
  visit  = 1506h 46min  (60.22%)
  travel = 164h 5min  (6.56%)
  wait   = 6h 40min  (0.27%)
  break  = 81h 0min  (3.24%)
  idle   = 743h 29min  (29.72%)
  sum    = 2502h 0min
  visit/shift = 60.22%
