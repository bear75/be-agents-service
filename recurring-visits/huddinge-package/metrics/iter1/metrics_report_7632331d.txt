TIMEFOLD FSR METRICS REPORT
========================================================================

--- Key metrics ---
  Paid time (shift − break)  = 1559h 15min  [salary cost]
  Visit time (value)         = 1083h 16min  [care delivery / revenue]
  Travel + wait (minimize)    = 475h 59min  [cost to minimize]

--- KPI: Efficiency % ---
  Efficiency (visit / (shift − break))     69.47%  [staffing]
  Travel efficiency (visit / (visit+travel))  78.68%  [field, target >67.5%]
  Wait efficiency (visit / (visit+travel+wait))  69.47%
  Idle efficiency (visit / (visit+travel+idle))  78.68%  [≈ efficiency]
  System efficiency (visit / all provisioned)  69.47%  [incl. 54 empty shifts]

--- Times (h:min) ---
  shift   = 1638h 15min
  visit   = 1083h 16min
  travel  = 293h 28min
  wait    = 182h 32min
  break   = 79h 0min
  idle    = 0h 0min  [inactive / empty shift time]
  sum     = 1638h 15min  (visit+travel+wait+break+idle)

--- Counts ---
  Employees (vehicles):  38  (empty: 0)
  Shifts:                340  (with visits: 286, empty: 54)
  Visits assigned:       2423 / 3622
  Unassigned:            1199

--- Input ---
  Care visits: 3478 (3334 solo + 144 double-employee)
  Timefold visits: 3622 (3334 solo + 288 in 144 groups)
  Time window slots: 3622 (movable across weeks)
  Vehicles: 38  Shifts: 340

--- Time equation: shift = visit + travel + wait + break + idle ---
  shift  = 1638h 15min  (100.00%)
  visit  = 1083h 16min  (66.12%)
  travel = 293h 28min  (17.91%)
  wait   = 182h 32min  (11.14%)
  break  = 79h 0min  (4.82%)
  idle   = 0h 0min  (0.00%)
  sum    = 1638h 15min
  visit/shift = 66.12%
