TIMEFOLD FSR METRICS REPORT
========================================================================

--- Key metrics ---
  Paid time (shift − break)  = 2403h 30min  [salary cost]
  Visit time (value)         = 1497h 11min  [care delivery / revenue]
  Travel + wait (minimize)    = 387h 24min  [cost to minimize]

--- KPI: Efficiency % ---
  Efficiency (visit / (shift − break))     62.29%  [staffing]
  Travel efficiency (visit / (visit+travel))  82.03%  [field, target >67.5%]
  Wait efficiency (visit / (visit+travel+wait))  79.44%
  Idle efficiency (visit / (visit+travel+idle))  63.87%  [≈ efficiency]
  System efficiency (visit / all provisioned)  62.29%  [incl. 28 empty shifts]

--- Times (h:min) ---
  shift   = 2502h 0min
  visit   = 1497h 11min
  travel  = 327h 54min
  wait    = 59h 30min
  break   = 98h 30min
  idle    = 518h 55min  [inactive / empty shift time]
  sum     = 2502h 0min  (visit+travel+wait+break+idle)

--- Counts ---
  Employees (vehicles):  38  (empty: 0)
  Shifts:                340  (with visits: 312, empty: 28)
  Visits assigned:       3540 / 3622
  Unassigned:            82

--- Input ---
  Care visits: 3478 (3334 solo + 144 double-employee)
  Timefold visits: 3622 (3334 solo + 288 in 144 groups)
  Time window slots: 3622 (movable across weeks)

--- Time equation: shift = visit + travel + wait + break + idle ---
  shift  = 2502h 0min  (100.00%)
  visit  = 1497h 11min  (59.84%)
  travel = 327h 54min  (13.11%)
  wait   = 59h 30min  (2.38%)
  break  = 98h 30min  (3.94%)
  idle   = 518h 55min  (20.74%)
  sum    = 2502h 0min
  visit/shift = 59.84%
