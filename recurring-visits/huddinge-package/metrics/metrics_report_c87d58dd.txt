TIMEFOLD FSR METRICS REPORT  (EXCLUDING INACTIVE)
========================================================================

--- Key metrics ---
  Paid time (shift − break)  = 2123h 0min  [salary cost]
  Visit time (value)         = 1515h 37min  [care delivery / revenue]
  Travel + wait (minimize)    = 244h 22min  [cost to minimize]

--- KPI: Efficiency % ---
  Efficiency (visit / (shift − break))     71.39%  [staffing]
  Travel efficiency (visit / (visit+travel))  86.97%  [field, target >67.5%]
  Wait efficiency (visit / (visit+travel+wait))  86.11%
  Idle efficiency (visit / (visit+travel+idle))  71.97%  [≈ efficiency]

--- Times (h:min) ---
  shift   = 2203h 30min
  visit   = 1515h 37min
  travel  = 227h 9min
  wait    = 17h 14min
  break   = 80h 30min
  idle    = 363h 0min  [inactive / empty shift time]
  sum     = 2203h 30min  (visit+travel+wait+break+idle)

--- Counts ---
  Employees (vehicles):  42  (empty: 0)
  Shifts:                311  (with visits: 311, empty: 0)
  Visits assigned:       3616 / 3622
  Unassigned:            6

--- Input ---
  Care visits: 3478 (3334 solo + 144 double-employee)
  Timefold visits: 3622 (3334 solo + 288 in 144 groups)
  Time window slots: 3622 (movable across weeks)
  Vehicles: 42  Shifts: 412

--- Time equation: shift = visit + travel + wait + break + idle ---
  shift  = 2203h 30min  (100.00%)
  visit  = 1515h 37min  (68.78%)
  travel = 227h 9min  (10.31%)
  wait   = 17h 14min  (0.78%)
  break  = 80h 30min  (3.65%)
  idle   = 363h 0min  (16.47%)
  sum    = 2203h 30min
  visit/shift = 68.78%

--- Time & Cost Breakdown (inactive removed: 363h 0min / 83,492 kr) ---
  Category                     Time   % shift   Cost (kr)    Rev (kr)
  ──────────────────── ────────────  ────────  ──────────  ──────────
  Active shift          1840h 30min   100.00%     423,313

    Travel time           227h 9min    12.34%      52,244            
    Wait time             17h 14min     0.94%       3,963            
    Break time            80h 30min     4.37%      18,515            

--- Margin (excluding inactive) ---
  Revenue:  833,589 kr
  Cost:     423,313 kr
  Margin:   410,276 kr  (49.22%)

--- Costs to minimize (travel, wait) + break ---
  Travel:   52,244 kr  (227h 9min)  [minimize]
  Wait:     3,963 kr  (17h 14min)  [minimize]
  Break:    18,515 kr  (80h 30min)
