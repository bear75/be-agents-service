TIMEFOLD FSR METRICS REPORT
========================================================================

--- Key metrics ---
  Paid time (shift − break)  = 1759h 59min  [salary cost]
  Visit time (value)         = 1515h 37min  [care delivery / revenue]
  Travel + wait (minimize)    = 244h 22min  [cost to minimize]

--- KPI: Efficiency % ---
  Efficiency (visit / (shift − break))     86.12%  [staffing]
  Travel efficiency (visit / (visit+travel))  86.97%  [field, target >67.5%]
  Wait efficiency (visit / (visit+travel+wait))  86.12%
  Idle efficiency (visit / (visit+travel+idle))  86.97%  [≈ efficiency]
  System efficiency (visit / all provisioned)  86.12%  [incl. 101 empty shifts]

--- Times (h:min) ---
  shift   = 1840h 29min
  visit   = 1515h 37min
  travel  = 227h 7min
  wait    = 17h 15min
  break   = 80h 30min
  idle    = 0h 0min  [inactive / empty shift time]
  sum     = 1840h 29min  (visit+travel+wait+break+idle)

--- Counts ---
  Employees (vehicles):  42  (empty: 0)
  Shifts:                412  (with visits: 311, empty: 101)
  Visits assigned:       3616 / 3622

--- Time equation: shift = visit + travel + wait + break + idle ---
  shift  = 1840h 29min  (100.00%)
  visit  = 1515h 37min  (82.35%)
  travel = 227h 7min  (12.34%)
  wait   = 17h 15min  (0.94%)
  break  = 80h 30min  (4.37%)
  idle   = 0h 0min  (0.00%)
  sum    = 1840h 29min
  visit/shift = 82.35%
